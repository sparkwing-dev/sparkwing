# Migrating to the next release

Go callers of `pkg/store` update one call site; nothing else changes on a
running install.

## SettleCardPayment returns the matched warning

`Store.SettleCardPayment` gains a middle return, a `*store.WarnedCardPayment`
that is nil unless an actionable early fraud warning matched the payment or
the card that paid. It names the warning, the debt the payment repaid and the
rest the ledger does not hold. A caller alerts on it, because a warned payment
either repays a pay-now debt with the team held or grants nothing, and any
unapplied rest is the operator's to return.

- **Before:** `created, err := st.SettleCardPayment(ctx, payment, now)`
- **After:** `created, warned, err := st.SettleCardPayment(ctx, payment, now)`

A redelivery of a settled payment returns nil, so an alert keyed on it fires
once per payment.
