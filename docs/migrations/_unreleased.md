# Migrating to the next release

## Dashboard session and CSRF cookies carry the `__Host-` prefix

On a dashboard that keeps `Secure` cookies, the session and CSRF cookies are
now named `__Host-sw_session` and `__Host-sw_csrf` rather than `sw_session` and
`sw_csrf`. A browser refuses a `__Host-` cookie that carries a `Domain`
attribute, which is the write a sibling host under the same registrable domain
would use to plant a session on a victim.

Every signed-in browser is signed out once on upgrade, because the old cookie
names are no longer read. Signing in again is the whole of the recovery.

A custom browser client that reads the CSRF token out of `document.cookie` to
fill `X-CSRF-Token` reads `__Host-sw_csrf` first and falls back to `sw_csrf`,
because a deployment running `SPARKWING_WEB_INSECURE_COOKIES=1` drops the
prefix along with `Secure`. See [auth.md](../auth.md#dashboard-authorization) for
the cookie contract.

## Runners carry a cache grant instead of the cache token

A runner no longer reads `SPARKWING_CACHE_TOKEN`. After each claim it asks the
controller's `POST /api/v1/runs/<run>/cache-grant` for a grant naming the
run's team, and the run's cache traffic carries that grant. The token let any
team's pipeline read and replace every other team's cached binaries, which the
other team's launcher then executed.

- Delete `cache_token` from `agent.yaml`; the agent refuses to load a file
  that still carries it. The installer no longer writes it.
- The runner-bundle chart no longer sets `SPARKWING_CACHE_TOKEN` on the runner.
  A runner deployed by hand should drop it too, because the pipeline binary
  can read its launcher's environment.
- The controller must hold the cache's token (`SPARKWING_CACHE_TOKEN` on the
  controller) to mint grants. Until it does, or on a controller that predates
  the route, runs go without the binary cache and compile instead.
- The pipeline binary a trigger runs no longer inherits the launcher's whole
  environment. It gets the Go toolchain, proxy, locale and Kubernetes service
  variables, `AWS_REGION`, `SPARKWING_*` and `OTEL_*` settings that are not
  credentials, and the run's own `SPARKWING_AGENT_TOKEN` and
  `SPARKWING_CACHE_GRANT`. A pipeline that relied on another launcher variable
  should receive it as a secret instead.
