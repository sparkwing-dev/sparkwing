# Migrating to the next release

The `sparkwing-full` chart now refuses to render a controller that would start
unauthenticated. Installs that already name a bootstrap admin token Secret need
nothing; every other install sets one value on upgrade.

## sparkwing-full requires a bootstrap admin token

- **Before:** `controller.requireAuth` defaulted to `false` and
  `controller.bootstrapAdminToken.name` to empty. A fresh install served every
  controller route, including `POST /api/v1/tokens` and first-admin creation,
  unauthenticated to anything that reached the Service until a token was minted
  and the controller restarted.
- **After:** `controller.requireAuth` defaults to `true`, and the render fails
  with an error naming both options while `controller.bootstrapAdminToken.name`
  is empty and `controller.allowOpenBootstrap` is not `true`.
- **Upgrade, recommended:** create a Secret holding a token-shaped value and
  name it. The controller ignores it once a live token exists, and
  `--require-auth` keeps refusing to start if the tokens table is ever emptied:

  ```bash
  # The umask makes the file 0600: it holds an admin bearer.
  (umask 077 && printf 'swu_%s' "$(openssl rand -hex 24)" > "$HOME/sparkwing-bootstrap-admin")
  kubectl -n sparkwing create secret generic sparkwing-bootstrap-admin \
      --from-file=token="$HOME/sparkwing-bootstrap-admin"
  helm upgrade sparkwing ./charts/sparkwing-full --namespace sparkwing -f my-values.yaml \
      --set controller.bootstrapAdminToken.name=sparkwing-bootstrap-admin
  ```

- **Upgrade, keeping the previous shape:** set
  `controller.allowOpenBootstrap=true`. The chart then omits `--require-auth`.
  A controller that already holds a live token stays authenticated; one whose
  tokens table is empty serves every route unauthenticated until a token is
  minted and it restarts, as before. The value must be a YAML bool; a quoted
  string fails the render.
- **Edge cases:** `controller.requireAuth=false` also renders without a
  bootstrap token and keeps the old behavior. Values files that set
  `requireAuth: true` without a bootstrap token, which crash-looped a fresh
  install, now fail at render time instead.

The OIDC subject gains a repository segment, so every cloud trust policy that matches `sub` must be rewritten before the controller is upgraded, or the roles it guards refuse Sparkwing tokens. Nothing else in this release needs a change.

## OIDC subject names the repository

The `sub` of a controller-issued ID token now carries GitHub's numeric repository id between the team and the pipeline. Before, two repositories of one team that subscribed the same pipeline name minted the same subject, so a push to `main` of either repository satisfied a trust policy meant for one of them.

- **Before:** `team:acme:pipeline:deploy:trigger:push:runner:runner:ref:refs/heads/main`
- **After:** `team:acme:repository_id:123456789:pipeline:deploy:trigger:push:runner:runner:ref:refs/heads/main`

Every trust policy, federated credential or role that matches `sub` must be updated:

1. Find the repository id: `gh api repos/<owner>/<name> --jq .id`.
2. Insert `repository_id:<id>:` after `team:<team>:` in every AWS `StringEquals` or `StringLike` condition on `<issuer>:sub`, every Entra federated credential `subject`, and every Vault `bound_subject` or glob on `sub`.
3. A token minted before the upgrade carries the old subject and lives at most one token lifetime (10 minutes by default), so to avoid a gap, admit both forms during the rollout and drop the old one afterwards. In AWS that is a list of both values under `StringLike`; in Entra, a second federated credential.

AWS trust policy, before:

```json
"StringLike": {"api.sparkwing.dev:sub": "team:acme:pipeline:deploy:trigger:push:runner:runner:ref:refs/heads/main"}
```

After:

```json
"StringLike": {"api.sparkwing.dev:sub": "team:acme:repository_id:123456789:pipeline:deploy:trigger:push:runner:runner:ref:refs/heads/main"}
```

**Edge cases:**

- The segment is set only when a GitHub App delivery started the run, or when a retry or child run inherits that repository. Runs from a legacy per-pipeline webhook, the CLI, the API or a schedule carry an empty segment, `team:acme:repository_id::pipeline:...`. A policy for such runs inserts `repository_id::`.
- A policy that ends in `*` after an earlier segment, such as `team:acme:*`, keeps matching, and now also matches every repository. Narrow it to `team:acme:repository_id:<id>:*` when the role belongs to one repository.
- Google Cloud and Vault examples that condition on the individual claims keep working, but they should add a condition on `repository`, because a pipeline name is not unique across a team's repositories. See [OIDC tokens for cloud roles](../oidc.md).
