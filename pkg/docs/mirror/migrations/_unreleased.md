# Migrating to the next release

The cache service keeps a run's cache entries apart by repository and git ref.
Nothing needs configuring; expect more cache misses on new branches at first.

## Cache entries follow the repository and ref

**Before:** every run of a team read and wrote one shared set of `/cache`,
`/bin` and `/artifacts` entries in the cache service, so a pull request's run
could replace the dependency archive or binary a later `main` run restored.

**After:** the cache grant a run receives carries its repository and refs, read
by the controller from the run's trigger. The run writes only under its own
ref and reads, in order, its own ref, its pull request's base branch, the
repository's default branch, and finally the entries written before this
release.

A run whose ref and commit its submitter chose writes under a ref of its own,
so it reads what its branch's pushes wrote but never replaces it. That covers
runs started from the CLI, the API and the dashboard, and retries or child
runs that descend from one of them. Runs whose ref the server holds write
under the real ref and warm the caches pushes read: runs a signed GitHub
webhook started, scheduled runs that follow a branch tip, and retries or child
runs of either that keep its ref and commit and upload no source. A schedule
pinned to a commit counts as submitter-chosen, because any editor can pin one
to a commit that is not on the branch.

**What you see:** the first run on a new branch restores its base branch's
cache as before. A branch's writes stay on that branch, so a sibling branch or
another repository of the team no longer finds them and rebuilds. Artifacts a
node hands to later nodes are content-addressed and stay shared by the team,
so a memoized or retried node still stages them on any ref. Entries from
before the upgrade stay readable by every run until a run writes the same key
under its own ref. A grant minted by an older controller keeps the old
team-wide behavior until it expires, so upgrade the controller and the cache
together.

**Why:** a deploy role that trusts `ref:refs/heads/main` relies on branch
protection deciding what runs on `main`; a shared cache let a branch's run put
code into a later `main` run.
