# Migrating to the next release

The `sparkwing-full` chart now refuses to render a controller that would start
unauthenticated. Installs that already name a bootstrap admin token Secret need
nothing; every other install sets one value on upgrade.

## sparkwing-full requires a bootstrap admin token

- **Before:** `controller.requireAuth` defaulted to `false` and
  `controller.bootstrapAdminToken.name` to empty. A fresh install served every
  controller route, including `POST /api/v1/tokens` and first-admin creation,
  unauthenticated to anything that reached the Service until a token was minted
  and the controller restarted.
- **After:** `controller.requireAuth` defaults to `true`, and the render fails
  with an error naming both options while `controller.bootstrapAdminToken.name`
  is empty and `controller.allowOpenBootstrap` is not `true`.
- **Upgrade, recommended:** create a Secret holding a token-shaped value and
  name it. The controller ignores it once a live token exists, and
  `--require-auth` keeps refusing to start if the tokens table is ever emptied:

  ```bash
  printf 'swu_%s' "$(openssl rand -hex 24)" > bootstrap-admin
  kubectl -n sparkwing create secret generic sparkwing-bootstrap-admin \
      --from-file=token=bootstrap-admin
  helm upgrade sparkwing ./charts/sparkwing-full -f my-values.yaml \
      --set controller.bootstrapAdminToken.name=sparkwing-bootstrap-admin
  ```

- **Upgrade, keeping the previous shape:** set
  `controller.allowOpenBootstrap=true`. The chart then omits `--require-auth`.
  A controller that already holds a live token stays authenticated; one whose
  tokens table is empty serves every route unauthenticated until a token is
  minted and it restarts, as before. The value must be a YAML bool; a quoted
  string fails the render.
- **Edge cases:** `controller.requireAuth=false` also renders without a
  bootstrap token and keeps the old behavior. Values files that set
  `requireAuth: true` without a bootstrap token, which crash-looped a fresh
  install, now fail at render time instead.
